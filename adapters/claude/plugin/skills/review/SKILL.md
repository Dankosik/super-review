Use Super Review for this request: $ARGUMENTS

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/resources/super-review/SKILL.md` using Read.
Follow its Claude adapter and return the report in this conversation. Accept a
PR, local changes, or explicitly requested whole-project source. For help, explain
usage without starting a review. For an actual review with no identifiable source,
ask only for the missing target; do not reacquire a target already given.
